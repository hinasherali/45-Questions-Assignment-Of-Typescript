//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just 
//printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the 
//person’s name.

let friendsName = ["Abu Bakar", "Hina", "Iqra", "Yosuf"];
friendsName.forEach(dost => console.log(`Hey ${dost}, Will meet you tomorrow`));
